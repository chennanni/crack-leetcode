A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: 
If A is a parent node of B then the key of node A is ordered with respect to the key of node B with the same ordering applying across the heap.

- Min-Heap − where the value of root node is less than or equal to either of its children.
- Max-Heap − where the value of root node is greater than or equal to either of its children.
