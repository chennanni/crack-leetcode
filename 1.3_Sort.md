# Sort

## Quick Sort

**Choose a pivot and put elements on left or right of it, do it recursively**

Time Complexity: average O(nlogn), worst O(n^2)

- **Choose a pivot value**. We take the value of the middle element as pivot value. (it can be any value even not in the array)
- **Partition**. Rearrange elements in such a way that:
 - All elements lesser than the pivot go to the left part of the array
 - All elements greater than the pivot go to the right part of the array.
 - Values equal to the pivot can stay in any part of the array.
- **Sort both parts**. Apply quicksort algorithm recursively to the left and the right parts.

```
int partition(int arr[], int left, int right)
{
      int i = left, j = right;
      int tmp;
      int pivot = arr[(left + right) / 2];

      while (i <= j) {
            while (arr[i] < pivot)
                  i++;
            while (arr[j] > pivot)
                  j--;
            if (i <= j) {
                  tmp = arr[i];
                  arr[i] = arr[j];
                  arr[j] = tmp;
                  i++;
                  j--;
            }
      };

      return i;
}

void quickSort(int arr[], int left, int right) {
      int index = partition(arr, left, right);
      if (left < index - 1)
            quickSort(arr, left, index - 1);
      if (index < right)
            quickSort(arr, index, right);
}
```

## Merge Sort

**divide to n single unit and then merge**

- Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
- Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

```
function merge_sort(list m)
    // Base case. A list of zero or one elements is sorted, by definition.
    if length(m) <= 1
        return m

    // Recursive case. First, *divide* the list into equal-sized sublists.
    var list left, right
    var integer middle = length(m) / 2
    for each x in m before middle
         add x to left
    for each x in m after or equal middle
         add x to right

    // Recursively sort both sublists
    left = merge_sort(left)
    right = merge_sort(right)

    // Then merge the now-sorted sublists.
    return merge(left, right)

function merge(left, right)
    var list result
    while notempty(left) and notempty(right)
        if first(left) <= first(right)
            append first(left) to result
            left = rest(left)
        else
            append first(right) to result
            right = rest(right)
    // either left or right may have elements left
    while notempty(left)
        append first(left) to result
        left = rest(left)
    while notempty(right)
        append first(right) to result
        right = rest(right)
    return result
```

## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. Each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

```
for (int i=1; i<A.length; i++) {
  j=i;
  while (j > 0) {
    if (A[j] < A[j-1]) {
      swap(A[j], A[j-1]);
    }
    j--;
  }
}
```

## Bubble Sort

**bigger bubbles keep coming to the top of water**

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Compare each pair of adjacent elements from the beginning of an array and, if they are in reversed order, swap them.
- If at least one swap has been done, repeat step 1.

```
public void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
      boolean swapped = true;
      int j = 0;
      int tmp;
      while (swapped) {
            swapped = false;
            j++;
            for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - j; i++) {
                  if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                        tmp = arr[i];
                        arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
                        arr[i + 1] = tmp;
                        swapped = true;
                  }
            }
      }
}
```
