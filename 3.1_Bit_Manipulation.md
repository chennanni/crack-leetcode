## Bitwise Operator
```
NOT ( ~ )
AND ( & )
OR ( | )
XOR ( ^ )
Left Shift ( << )
Right Shift ( >> )
```

**>>> compare to >>**

`>>>` is logical shift, also known as unsigned shift, it moves every bit
```
01111111 >>> 2 = 00011111
10000000 >>> 2 = 00100000
```

`>>` is arthematic shift, also known as signed shift, it does not move the sign bit
```
01111111 >> 2 = 00011111
10000000 >> 2 = 11100000
```

## Example 1
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

```
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
    		while(n != 0) {
    			count += n&1;
    			n >>>= 1; 
    		}
    		return count;
    }
}
```
